## Phases

Phases are an abstract concept designed to fit most web servers execution flows and give it more oportunities to stop a request.

### Phase 1: Request Headers

This phase will process rules with the following variables:

- HTTP connection data, like IPs, ports and protocol version
- URI and GET arguments
- Request Headers: cookies, content-type and content-length

### Phase 2: Request Body

This phase will process rules with the following variables:

- POST arguments
- Multipart arguments and files
- JSON and XML data
- Raw Request Body

### Phase 3: Response Headers

This phase will process rules with the following variables:

- Response status code
- Response headers: content-length and content-type

### Phase 4: Response Body

This phase will process rules with the following variables:

- Raw Response body

### Phase 5: Logging

This phase will evaluate phase 5 rules, save persistent collections and write the log entry. This phase is not disruptive and it may run after the response was sent to the client.

## How rules are sorted

Rules **are not** sorted by id, they are sorted by phase and compilation order. For example:

```
SecAction "id:1,phase:3,logdata:'first rule',log"
SecAction "id:150,phase:2,logdata:'second rule',log"
SecAction "id:300,phase:1,logdata:'third rule',log"
```

This will evaluate the rules based on it's phase, not its id, and show the following `logdata`:

```
third rule
second rule
first rule
```

## Secmarkers

[SecMarker](#) is a directive that creates an abstract rule, without rules, operators and actions, that will only work as a placeholder to tell the transaction under which SecMarker we are.

```
SecMarker BEGIN_HOST_CHECK

SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Host "@eq 0" "phase:1,id:1,pass"
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Host "^$" "phase:1,id:2,pass"

SecMarker END_HOST_CHECK
```

This will "mark" rules 1 and 2 as `BEGIN_HOST_CHECK`, which will be used by [skipAfter]({{< relref "actions#skipafter" >}}) action to skip the following rules after the "SecMark" was reached, for example:

```
SecAction "id:1, phase:1,skipAfter:END_HOST_CHECK"
SecMarker BEGIN_HOST_CHECK

SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Host "@eq 0" "phase:1,id:2,pass"
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Host "^$" "phase:1,id:3,pass"

SecMarker END_HOST_CHECK
SecAction "id:4,phase:1,pass"
```

In the example above, rules 2 and 3 will be skipped because they are marked as ```BEGIN_HOST_CHECK``` and not ```END_HOST_CHECK``` as expected by ```skipAfter```.

## Other flow controllers

[Skip]({{< relref "actions#skip" >}}) action can also be used to skip the N following rules, for example:

```
SecAction "id:1,phase:1, skip:1"

# The following rule won't be evaluated
SecAction "id:2"

# This rule will be evaluated
SecAction "id:3"
```
