**Important:** OWASP Core Ruleset requires [coraza-libinjection](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-libinjection) and [coraza-pcre](https://github.com/jptosso/coraza-pcre) plugins to work. There is an upcoming fork that removes the need for the plugins by removing a few features and rewriting some @rx operators to RE2 instead of PCRE.

## Installation

Core Ruleset can be normally installed by importing each required file in the following order:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jptosso/coraza-waf/v2/master/coraza.conf-recommended -O coraza.conf
git clone https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset
```

1. coraza.conf
2. coreruleset/crs-setup.conf.example
3. coreruleset/rules/*.conf

For example:

```go
func initCoraza(){
  waf := coraza.NewWaf()
  parser, _ := seclang.NewParser(waf)
  files := []string{
    "coraza.conf",
    "coreruleset/crs-setup.conf.example",
    "coreruleset/rules/*.conf",
  }
  for _, f := range files {
    if err := parser.FromFile(f); err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration
