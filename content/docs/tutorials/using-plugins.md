Plugins must be included in your project's main package, for example:

```go
package main

include(
  "github.com/coraza-waf/coraza/v2"
  _ "github.com/jptosso/coraza-libinjection"
)
```

The previous code will automatically add the @detectXSS and @detectSQLi operators. (Please note this plugin requires libinjection)
